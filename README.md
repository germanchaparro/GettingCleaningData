# Getting and Cleaning Data assignment

## How it works
Please be sure to uncompress the getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file. This creates the folder UCI HAR Dataset.
The run_analysis.R file must be AT THE SAME LEVEL as the folder UCI HAR Dataset. By using R or R Studio please be sure to set the working directory to the same location of run_analysis.R. You can use the command setwd or in R Studio with the menu "Session/Set Working Directory/To Source File Location"
Finally you can type source("run_analysis.R"). It will take about 20 seconds to generate the file meansBySubjectActivity.txt which is the output file
